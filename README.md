# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of E-Commerce Sales

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an e-commerce sales dataset to uncover insights about product sales, customer behavior, and order performance. The analysis uses Python along with popular data manipulation and visualization libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column Name       | Description                                         |

| **OrderID**       | Unique identifier for each order.                   |
| **ProductName**   | Name of the product purchased.                      |
| **Category**      | Product category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing).     |
| **Price**         | Price of a single unit of the product.              |
| **Quantity**      | Number of units purchased in the order.             |
| **CustomerID**    | Unique identifier for each customer.                |
| **OrderDate**     | Date when the order was placed.                     |
| **DeliveryDate**  | Date when the order was delivered.                  |
| **Rating**        | Customer's rating for the product (1–5 scale).      |

| **ShippingCost**  | Cost of shipping the order.                         |
| **Discount**      | Discount applied to the order.                      |
| **Warehouse**     | Warehouse location that fulfilled the order.        |
| **CustomerLocation** | Geographic location of the customer.             |

## Objectives
1. Understand sales trends and customer purchasing patterns.
2. Analyze product performance by categories, ratings, and reviews.
3. Evaluate shipping and warehouse efficiency.
4. Investigate correlations between discounts, prices, and sales volume.
5. Provide actionable insights for business growth.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
